  The paper shows that an inclined laser absorbed in an elastic half-space creates a tunable volume thermoelastic source 
  whose broken symmetry modifies compressional and shear wave directivity patterns, allowing enhancement and steering of 
  specific bulk acoustic modes through light refraction.
