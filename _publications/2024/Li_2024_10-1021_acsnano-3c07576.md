  This paper demonstrates that cleaved superlattices of (Alx Ga1-x As)/(Aly Ga1-y As) can serve as optically controlled 
  nanotransducers to generate and detect coherent surface and bulk acoustic waves between 40–70 GHz, offering a pathway 
  toward sub-THz coherent nanoacoustics beyond the limits of conventional IDTs and nanopatterned transducers.
