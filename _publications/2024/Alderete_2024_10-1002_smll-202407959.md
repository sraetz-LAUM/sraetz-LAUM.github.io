  This paper characterizes the phononic behavior of natural Nacre using non-contact pump-probe laser ultrasonics and 
  Brillouin spectroscopy, showing that at wavelengths longer than its brick-and-mortar microstructure it behaves as a 
  dispersionless, transversely isotropic medium, while at wavelengths comparable to this periodicity a complex phononic 
  spectrum emerges.
