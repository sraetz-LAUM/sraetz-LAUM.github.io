  This paper shows that when a laser beam enters a semi-transparent material at an oblique angle, the resulting asymmetric 
  thermoelastic source significantly alters bulk wave generation. It enhances shear waves, alters compressional waves, and 
  produces asymmetric acoustic behavior confirmed by both experiments and modeling.
