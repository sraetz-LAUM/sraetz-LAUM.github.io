  This paper shows that time-domain Brillouin scattering enables high-resolution 3D imaging of polycrystalline high-pressure 
  ice in determining grain shape, location, phase, and crystallographic orientation from quasi-longitudinal and quasi-shear 
  coherent acoustic pulse measurements, while simultaneous pulse monitoring across neighboring grains provides a new tool 
  for grain-boundary localization.
