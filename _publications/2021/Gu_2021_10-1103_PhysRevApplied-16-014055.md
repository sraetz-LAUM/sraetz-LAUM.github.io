  This paper uses picosecond acoustic methods to study GeTe, revealing that during amorphous-to-crystalline phase 
  transformation, electron-phonon coupling evolves and photoexcited energy transport becomes nonthermal and supersonic 
  in the crystalline state, contrasting with localized behavior in the amorphous state.
