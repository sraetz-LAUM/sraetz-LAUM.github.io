  This paper demonstrates the first use of picosecond laser ultrasonics to non-destructively evaluate acoustical and 
  optical properties of a lateral compositionally graded film, the (Ba1-x Srx TiO3) material library, showing the 
  technique robustness despite thickness and roughness variations and providing key parameters for designing advanced 
  multifunctional nanodevices.
