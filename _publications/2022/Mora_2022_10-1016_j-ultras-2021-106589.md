  This paper demonstrates theoretically and experimentally that zero-group velocity (ZGV) Lamb modes can be generated 
  via sum-frequency interaction of two high-amplitude primary waves, serving as a sensitive local probe of material 
  nonlinearity and producing detectable effects at very low input power in weakly nonlinear aluminum plates.
