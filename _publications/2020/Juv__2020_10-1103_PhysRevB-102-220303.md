  This paper uses picosecond time-resolved X-ray diffraction on BiFeO3 to simultaneously measure longitudinal and shear 
  photoinduced strains, revealing distinct dynamical responses linked to quasilongitudinal and quasitransverse acoustic 
  modes, and showing that both thermal and nonthermal processes drive acoustic phonon generation.
