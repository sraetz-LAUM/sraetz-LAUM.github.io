  This paper applies time-domain Brillouin scattering to monitor the destruction of a lithium niobate single crystal 
  under non-hydrostatic compression, showing that 3D TDBS can locally evaluate thickness variations and interface 
  inclinations from single-point measurements, without requiring profilometry.
