  This paper develops a theory for time-domain Brillouin scattering with angled coherent acoustic and light pulses, 
  predicting how beam geometry and CAP properties affect transient reflectivity signals and showing that single-point 
  TDBS can reveal both depth and local orientation of buried interfaces.
