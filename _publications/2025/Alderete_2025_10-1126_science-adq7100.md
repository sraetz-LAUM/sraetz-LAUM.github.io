  This paper uses transient grating spectroscopy and picosecond laser ultrasonics, along with simulations, to show that 
  the mantis shrimpâ€™s dactyl club exhibits phononic features (Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow modes, 
  and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range) that filter harmful high-frequency stress waves from cavitation 
  bubble collapse, providing effective protection during strikes.
